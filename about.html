            <h2>About us</h2>
            <h3>Written by: ChatGPT</h3>
            <h4>
                Welcome to our small indie game studio located in Sweden, where we specialize in creating 2D games.
                Our
                team is passionate about designing and developing games that are both fun and engaging for players
                of
                all ages. <br><br>

                We believe that 2D games provide a unique and charming gaming experience that can't be found in
                other
                genres. Our goal is to create games that are not only visually appealing but also offer challenging
                gameplay and interesting storylines.<br><br>

                We take great pride in our work and strive to create games that stand out from the rest. We are
                committed to bringing our vision to life and delivering high-quality games that players will enjoy
                for
                years to come.<br><br>

                Thank you for considering our studio and we look forward to sharing our games with you!
